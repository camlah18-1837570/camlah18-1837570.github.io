        <p style="font-family:courier;">Hello, my name is Cameron and this is one of my INFO 101 builders. I am trying to achieve the Newbie level and I would love for you to recognize that this is my first font and that I will be using another font for the next paragraph. I love XP!</p>
        <p style="font-family:Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">You see! I told you, this is a completely different font! I love XP so much that I needed to complete this builder, and in order to do that I needed to figure out how to write in different fonts, and I did it!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
